1.  Summary
    In this lab a insertion and merge sort functions were implemented. All worked fine

2.  Analysis
insertion sort

    Best case: 1 2 3 4 5
        Comparisons: 4
        Swaps: 0
        Copy operations: 4
        Time complexity O(n)

    Worse case: 5 4 3 2 1
        Comparisons: 10
        Swaps: 10
        Copy operations: 4
        Time complexity O(n^2)
    
    Median case: 4 2 5 1 3
        Comparisons: 8
        Swaps: 6
        Copy operations: 4
        Time complexity O(n^2)


Merge sort
Time complexity recursive function T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î¸(n)

    Best case: 1 2 3 4 5
        Comparisons: 9
        Swaps: 0
        Copy operations: 19
        Time complexity O(nlog(n))

    Worse case: 5 4 3 2 1
        Comparisons: 9
        Swaps: 0
        Copy operations: 17
        Time complexity O(nlog(n))
    
    Median case: 4 2 5 1 3
        Comparisons: 9
        Swaps: 0
        opy operations: 19
        Time complexity O(nlog(n))
